Game idea:

Amorphous Plus style top-down melee game

Ideas:
sword based on kimetsu no yaiba(?) berserk(?)
name idea: onigiri(鬼切り?) akumakan(アクマカン?)<-LOL
Armor & weapon selectable at start, health bar system(?)
normal enemy: sword/spear/bow
Soul Knight styled random encounter/enchantment/stage/HP-armor system(?)
story mode following lore of different anime(?)
equipment unlock system, can use weapons/items from different animes/or unequip it for added challenge/achievements(?)
Probably can change HP style in custom mode(?)
HP/gold multiplier(?)
2P mode(?)
vs mode(?)
play as boss(?)
Musou stage(?)

Control: mouse control with movement speed (like Amorphous Plus), right click to dodge roll, left to attack (small pause after attacking),
some button to parry(/shield?)(instant counter? 360*counter?) charge attack(?) ranged weapon(?)
if possible change animation/ have attack pattern change depending combo count

Stage - hazard(?) walls(?) on/off option?
